# hello-world
first project

To the companies out there for whom I am making these projects, listen up!

If you make your mind, I'm the first in line;
Sir I'm still free;
Take a chance on me;
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around;
If you've got a place to give, if you're open now;

If you're open now when the pretty birds have flown;
Sir I'm still free;
Take a chance on me;
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie;
If you put me to the test, if you let me try;

Take a chance on me;
(That's all I ask of you Sir);
Take a chance on me;
